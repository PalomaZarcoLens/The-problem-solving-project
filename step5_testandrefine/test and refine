Sample tests scenarios:
-	Pet eats as expected: PASS
  o	Inputs: time, food level, bowl weight
  o	Outputs: dispense food, status displays: “feeding complete”
-	Pet does not eat: PASS
  o	Inputs: time, food level, bowl weight
  o	Outputs: alert: “food not eaten”
-	Food bin is empty: PASS
  o	Inputs: time, food level
  o	Outputs: alert: “no food available”
-	Manual override is pressed: PASS
  o	Inputs: button pressed, time
  o	Outputs: dispense food immediately
-	Sensor error: PASS
  o	Inputs: weight sensor
  o	Outputs: alert: “sensor error”

Discussion of logic:
-	Successes: the system correctly handles scheduled feeding, manual override, and basic alert conditions.
-	Weaknesses: no backup if sensors fail, alerts are passive (i.e., only messages)
-	Rare cases: what if the pets eat very slowly? What if food is spilled but not eaten?

Possible refinements:
-	Visual indicators: 
  o	Use LED colour codes (green is OK and red is alert) for quick staff contact.
-	Data logging: 
  o	Store feeding history and sensor data for analysis and improvement.
-	Add sensor error handling:
  o	Detect null or invalid readings and trigger a sensor error alert.
  o	Log errors for staff review (i.e., staff response time).
-	Retry mechanisms:
  o	If food isn’t eaten within 30 minutes, send a second alert or attempt re-dispensing.
-	Pet-specific profiles:
  o	Customize feeding times and portions per animal.
