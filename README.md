Project Overview

This project simulates the logic and behavior of a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder designed for a local animal shelter. The system is intended to dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times, monitor consumption, and alert staff if issues arise. It is built using a structured problem-solving approach and is suitable for future implementation using affordable components like servo motors and sensors.


Objectives
- Dispense pet food at scheduled times.
- Detect whether food has been consumed.
- Alert staff if food is not dispensed or not eaten.
- Operate using low-cost hardware and simple logic.


System Features
- Scheduled Feeding: Real-Time Clock (RTC)
- Food Level Monitoring using a level sensor
- Consumption Detection using a weight sensor
- Manual Override for emergency feeding
- Alert System using buzzer and display
- Status Feedback: optional LCD or serial output
