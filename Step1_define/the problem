The automated pet feeder must dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times, detect whether food has been consumed, and alert staff if dispensing fails or food remains uneaten. 
It should rely on low-cost components like servo motors and sensors, operate on a fixed schedule, and provide basic feedback through alerts or status indicators. 
Inputs include feeding times and sensor data, while outputs include motor control and alerts.
